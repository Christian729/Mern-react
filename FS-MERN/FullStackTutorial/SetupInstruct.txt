1. go into folder you want to host the project
then in the terminal
    mkdir ((project_name))
    cd ((project_name))

2. create a new folder called server and cd into it.
    mkdir server
    cd server

3. in gitbash create a new file called server.js
    touch server.js

4. create a new project via
    npm init -y

5. install our dependencies
    npm install express
    npm install mongoose

6. write the server code requiring express and where we launch our server

7. modularize the folder structure with config, controllers, models, and routes

8. now we'll go out of the server folder and create our client side (in this case our react app side)
    cd.. 
    npx create-react-app client



================AFTER YOU SET THAT UP=======================

IN the server

1.set up the controller 

2. set up routes/ also config if you havent done that 

3. set up the server.js



================ AFTER setting up the back end=========================

Go into your React project/ front end

1. install axios with
    npm install axios

2. make the components with your component

3. update the app.js

4. STOP the server and clients if theyre currently running

5. in the server, install cors with the command 
    npm install cors

6. update the server.js to require cors
